I'm working on the project @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/initial_plan.md and @README.md. The v1 design plan for this project is detailed in @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/0_filevyasa_design_plan_v1.md.
In this v1 implementation, after generating the proposed folder structure (as described in the "### Module Breakdown -> Folder Structure Planning Module" section), I need a practical and efficient approach to determine how to reorganize files and folders. This includes identifying: which folders should be moved along with their contained files; which folders should be moved and then merged with existing folders; which individual files should be relocated; and any other necessary actions for file organization.

The goal is to create a agentic algorithm that transforms the current folder structure to closely match the planned final folder structure. Note: real world messy folder data has to be turned into organised folders, and it has to work for many real world scenarios.

These are three algorithm suggestions to accomplish the above:
Algorithm 1:
@agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/file_organisation_algo/file_organisation_algo1_grok.md

Algorithm 2:
@agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/file_organisation_algo/file_organisation_algo2_grok.md

Algorithm 3:
@agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/file_organisation_algo/file_organisation_algo3_chatgpt.md


We want a very good algorithm, which works for real world cases, and It is preferable that the algorithm is not too complex as well.
We would like to create an agentic approach, enabling the agent to plan itself, giving the agent many tools which can perform operations like find cohesity of a particular folder, list tree of a folder, etc (operations given in the algorithms above). 


what are the tool calls that the agent may need, that need to be implemented? for example, some important operations performed in Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2,  or Algorithm 3 - which the agent can choose to perform in any order.  How is the agent planning and tool call going to be?

Look at the algorithm in @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/file_organisation_algo/file_organisation_suggestion_combined.md. How is this algorithm for this problem? 

Is there any addition or deletion to the algorithm, tool call, planning, design - such that it improves the agentic algorithm for this file organisation problem? any strategic improvement such that it gives new behavior and power to the agent to perform or plan better? Not needed if the refined algorithm is already reasonably optimum.
