- **Defaults and constraints**
  - Default to modern, stable, and well-supported stacks and patterns.
  - Centralize configuration and branding in constants that are easy to update.
  - Secure explicit approval before making any significant deviation from these rules.

- **Scope limitations**
  - Modify only code contained in `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/file-vyasa`. Code from other directories may be shared purely as inspiration; evaluate it without editing those sources. Do not alter files in:
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/ai-file-organizer`
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/ai-file-sorter`
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/constella`
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/llama-fs`
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/Local-File-Organizer`
    - `/Users/sreenivasanac/SoftwareProjects/organize`

- **Prompt usage**
  - Do not read or modify `agentic_development_docs/used_prompts/`; those prompts are finalized and out of scope.
  - When documentation is needed for a package, library, or framework, consult Context7.
